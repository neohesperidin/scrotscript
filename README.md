# scrotscript
a little script i made to take screenshots how i want them to be taken:
- save image named with unix timestamp (not 4chan moment it's just good for sorting)
- copy image to clipboard

by default outputs to ~/Pictures/screencap (it doesn't create this directory)

intended to be bound with your hotkey manager

`scrotscript` takes a screenshot of the whole screen

`scrotscript -r` takes a screenshot of a region picked with your mouse

`scrotscript -a` takes a screenshot of the active window
